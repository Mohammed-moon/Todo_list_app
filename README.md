# todo_jasonplaceholder

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# Todo App

## Overview

This is a simple Todo application built using Flutter. The app allows users to manage a list of tasks (todos) with basic CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete. The data is fetched and manipulated through RESTful API endpoints provided by the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which is a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.

## Features

- View a list of todos.
- Add a new todo.
- Update an existing todo.
- Delete a todo.
- Mark todos as completed or pending.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (including Dart)
- An IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Running the App

Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with the todo list:

    Add Todo: Tap the '+' button in the bottom right corner to add a new todo. Enter a title, set the completed status, and save.
    Edit Todo: Tap on a todo item to enter edit mode. Modify the title and completed status, then save.
    Delete Todo: Tap the trash can icon next to a todo item to delete it.
    Complete/Incomplete Todo: Check or uncheck the checkbox next to a todo item to mark it as completed or pending.

API Endpoints

The app interacts with the following endpoints from JSONPlaceholder:

    GET /todos - Fetch all todos
    GET /todos/1 - Fetch a specific todo
    POST /todos - Create a new todo
    PUT /todos/{id} - Update an existing todo
    DELETE /todos/{id} - Delete a todo
